Final Proposal

Background
My App "From The Farm To Your Table" App is an application that will try to provide a fun and interactive user experience that will allow users to rapidly look up what kind of fruits or vegetables are in season where they live or are traveling to to know what is the most fresh and sustainable ingredients to cook with or eat at restaurants. The page will be a data visualization with an interactive map of the US that will have clickable states that will grab the relevant information based on the month of the current date and the area they have clicked on. This will allow the user to plan accordingly for their shopping trips or their restaurant choices based on what they see through this app.
