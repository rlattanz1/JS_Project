Final Proposal

Background
My App "From The Farm To Your Table" App is an application that will try to provide a fun and interactive user experience that will allow users to rapidly look up what kind of fruits or vegetables are in season where they live or are traveling to to know what is the most fresh and sustainable ingredients to cook with or eat at restaurants. The page will be a data visualization with an interactive map of the US that will have clickable states that will grab the relevant information based on the month of the current date and the area they have clicked on. This will allow the user to plan accordingly for their shopping trips or their restaurant choices based on what they see through this app.

Functionality & MVPs

In "From The Farm To Your Table", users will be able to:

{ 4-6 core features or functionalities of your project }
-click on the areas where they live or are traveling to
-get seasonal produce information based on the time of year and location
-a music on and off toggle button for the seasonal music
-an aesthetic backroung basesd on the season
-idk something else if I am creative enough to come up with something
In addition, this project will include:

{ 2-4 other aspects of your project, including instructions & README }
-click on the states to provide a location for the search
-it will look pretty and have music hopefully!

Technologies, Libraries, APIs
an API to fetch data. Hopefully! Otherwise I will be seeding it myself or pivoting to a bird watching app with the same UI.

Timeline {
    day 1: get a gameplan and final proposal and talk to Chris to raise my moral and expunge my fears
    day 2: get a clickable map on my page with all the right hover funcitons for the map and get a music button in my html and also have a clickable event listener with a toggle function.
    day 3: start to get the API information or seeded information together and start to work on the AJAX logic for it and getting it working.
    day 4: style the shit out of my application page and make it look pretty
    day 5: make sure there are no bugs and check for the proper functionality with no issues
    day 6: Hopefully submit a cmpleted or mostly completed project!
